# Von

---

Von allows you to update all your forked projects at once.

** Requirements

This little script requires some extra steps in order to work.

1. All forked projects must have a `forked_` prefix.

2. your upstream alias must be `source`.

To add your upstream-

`git remote add [source] [upstream url]`

** Usage

This script requires you to put your Git root directory as parameter.

Running the script is so simple-

`von /path/git/root/dir`
